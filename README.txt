  A package for querying the Amazon PA API.

  Hand it your key, secret, associate id, and search information and
  it'll give you back the XML from the request, assuming your keys and
  assoc id are correct.

  You'll want to make sure you change the charset in (find-products) if you're not using UTF-8.
